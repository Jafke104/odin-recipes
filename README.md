# odin-recipes
The recipes project aims to create a basic recipe website using the introductory HTML learned in the Odin Project.

Upon the completion of this project I hope to display skills in using HTML basics such as lists, the HTML boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, image linking, and hyperlinks.
